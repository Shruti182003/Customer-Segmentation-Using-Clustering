#  Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It is part of my internship work at Celebal Technologies.

##  Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that helps businesses target their audience more effectively. In this project, we:

- Explored customer data through visualization
- Preprocessed and normalized the dataset
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to find customer segments
- Analyzed the resulting clusters to gain business insights

##  Dataset

The dataset includes attributes such as:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

##  Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Elbow Method and Silhoutte Score to find optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering implementation
- Cluster visualization
- Gender-based insights and segmentation

##  Output Visualization
- Scatter plots of clusters
- Distribution of income, spending, and age
- Cluster analysis by gender
